Project 4 - Breakout
By Nicole Ajoy

Both power-ups still count towards the total score.
The value depends on how far the box is from the paddle.
Images are located under the "data" folder.

There are two power-ups:

1. "Ghost Ball"

Effect: Ball collides with boxes without bouncing
Duration: 3 paddle collisions

2. "Big Paddle"
